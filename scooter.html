			<h1>Electric Scooters</h1>
			<p>Feeling adventurous? Electric scooters are a fun and fast way to get around the city. Using the same path along with people. Wanting to go along Oriental Bay but being too lazy to walk? Hope on an E-Scooter and it should do the trick for you.

				<p>With the easiest transport today, you need to download the Lime Scooter app. Only being located in the Hutt, but able to travel for 32km on a single charge. 50 cent to unlock and then 0.07 cent per minute. Only run electricity, Lime Scooterâ€™s goal is to make traveling faster, smarter, affordable, safer but also environmentally friendly. They connect riders to the people and places that matters most, bringing cities together and empowering better urban living. </p>

				<p>Riding a pink bird seems a little bizarre, but not this one! The Flamingo Scooter, not only is it a New Zealand brand but they're great fun. Being only in Auckland and Wellington but soon in Christchurch on September the 1st. Needing to also download the app available on the Apple App Store or Google Play. Out of all the E-Scooter services, Flamingo would be the cheaper ones and the ones that are easier to find around the CBD.</p>

				<p>Find, Ride, and Park. Jump Scooter would have to the second biggest more competitive to Flamingo. One of Jump's qualities is being owned by Uber for the taxi service. Only needing to download the Uber you already got two in one. Not only Jump is in Wellington and just Wellington in New Zealand, but you can also get Jump all around the world. From Paris to Seattle to Wellington. A fun way to travel with friends, family or by yourself. No matter what it's always going to be a fun time.
