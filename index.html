					<p>You’re in a big city like Wellington you need to be able to get from places to places, suburbs to suburbs and especially anywhere near home. Wellington has a vast variety of transport you can take. Lots of buses, reliable trains, safe taxis, and if you’re feeling adventurous hop on an electric scooter that you can zip through the city. </p>

					<p>When you have Te Papa in the CBD and then The Weta Cave on the other side of town you can’t just walk or scooter there. You need something faster, warmer and just overall cheaper. Buses are great. Public Transport, having most buses going through the CBD and then also 4 buses that can take you to the Weta Cave. Hire your own Uber. Download the app choose anytime you want them to pick you up and they’ll be there on the dot right in front of your step.</p>
