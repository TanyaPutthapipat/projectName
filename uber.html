				<p>Being one of the main cities in New Zealand, Wellington has taxis everywhere. Getting to the other side of town is the least of your worries. Business like Wellington Combined Taxis Limited, Kiwi Cabs Ltd, Corporate Cabs Wellington and etc are all very reliable, safe and provide fast and friendly service. Walking along Courtney Place you see them everywhere, giving people the convenience they need. Another way to use these services is that you can call up and thatâ€™s their main way of getting bookings and jobs. Call the company up and ask for a cab. They will ask you where you are when you want to be picked up and of course, where is your final destination. Best things about Taxis you can get them all over New Zealand, unlike Ola and Uber which are mostly based in big cities.</p>

				<p>It's raining, it's a little too far to walk or you're on a time limit. Hire your own personal car ride. Get a ride in minutes. Being the biggest online transport platform, Uber is finding you better ways to move. A multinational transportation network, based in San Franciso but has made it to Wellington. </p>

				<a href= "https://ola.co.nz/" target="_blank"><h3>Ola Cabs</h3></a>
				<p>Ola Cabs offers to book a cab near your location for the best fares. The company is based in Bangalore, India. Definitely, a student's first choice when it comes to going into town on a Friday or Saturday night, just because of the amazing deals that are up for offer. Not as popular as Uber but definitely a lot cheaper.</p>
